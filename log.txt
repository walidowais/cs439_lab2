30 min, Daniel driving, going over directions for lab 
30 min, Walid driving, the piazza hunt begins! 
30 min, Daniel driving, going over the queue and longjmp/setjmp
30 min, Walid driving, tested passing void * argments to function
30 min, Daniel driving, tested passing void * argments to function
30 min, Walid driving, looked about uintptr_t 


02/13 5:00pm - 7:00pm
30 min, Walid driving, gotta do them stack pointers and base pointer bro 
30 min, Daniel driving, making sure we're not missing stuff from thread struct
30 min, Walid driving, the piazza hunt begins! looking for stuff about the thread struct 
30 min, Daniel driving, made sure everything was uintptr_t 


02/14 9:00 PM - 1:00 AM
30 min, Daniel driving, implemented stack using posix_memalign 
30 min, Walid driving, writing the linkedlist 
30 min, Daniel driving, finished the linkedlist aka the queue 
30 min, Walid driving,  adding stuff to the end of the queue with thread_add_runqueue
30 min, Daniel driving, making sure our add is actually a queue 
30 min, Walid driving, watched the olympics for a bit, lol...
30 min, Daniel driving, still watching olympics :(
30 min, Walid driving, added some comments for readability  


02/15 9:00 PM - 2:00 AM 
30 min, Daniel driving, almost done with threads.c
30 min, Walid driving, figuring out where to put assembly 
30 min, Daniel driving, seems like dispatch => best place 
30 min, Walid driving, small testing here and there, trying to make sure every function runs without errors
30 min, Daniel driving, threw assembly code in woo 
30 min, Walid driving, oh god what is going on 
30 min, Daniel driving, why do segfaults exist? (segfaulted after thread 1)
30 min, Walid driving, seems like our jump function isn't correctly implemented. keep going to beginning of f1
30 min, Daniel driving, placing print statements to narrow down bug 
30 min, Walid driving,  has to do with our stupid dispatch cause we aren't loading stuff correctly


02/16 4:00pm - 11:30PM
30 min, Walid driving, trying to fix the terrible dispatch function 
30 min, Daniel driving, researching more about setjmp and longjmp 
30 min, Walid driving, a little bit lost about the assembly...
30 min, Daniel driving, tested passing void * argments to function
30 min, Walid driving, some GDB fun 
30 min, Daniel driving, more GDB fun, along with disassemble and checking to see if assembly matched 
30 min, Walid driving, at this point GDB really isn't fun. Seg faults are destroying our confidence... 
30 min, Daniel driving, decided to switch to valgrind, change up the pace. 
30 min, Walid driving, plagued with a terrible memory alloc error. Where the hell is our stack even at? 
30 min, Daniel driving, seems like we aren't allocating stack correctly 
30 min, Walid driving, massive testing to locate our bug 
30 min, Daniel driving, we forgot to add 4096 to our stack pointer. Everything works otherwise........ 
30 min, Walid driving, turns out there's a small bug with our frees #YOLO
